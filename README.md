Review: Propergeeks Ltd

Fantastic service from these very polite young lads. Everything explained in easy-to-understand language and the price paid was well within what I expected to pay. My laptop came away from Propergeeks performing like it did 10 years ago. I only wish they could do the same thing for me!

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Solution
A service is a model, a service belongs to a user but a user can have many services this is a one to many relationship

To the future me ;
Dear Dominic..
You cannot undo, but you should understand why that happened and how to prevent that from happening again in the future. This happened because Filezilla allows Drag-and-drop move functionality on both folders (directories) and files, very dangerous on production servers.
